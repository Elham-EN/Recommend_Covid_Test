# COVID Test Recommender

Meet the COVID Test Recommender, a user-friendly tool I built using C++ for a university project. This smart CLI app gives COVID test advice based on the user's answers to a few key questions.

Users tell the app about their recent whereabouts, their contact with others, and any symptoms they might have. The app takes this info, weighs it up, and suggests whether getting a COVID test might be a good idea.

It's a quick, simple tool to help guide people through these tricky times. But remember, it's just a guide - it's always important to seek advice from a healthcare professional.
